Python ioctl constants and functions module

Author: SpliFF
License: Public Domain

Mostly follows specifications in asm-generic/ioctl.h from linux 2.5.36

Notable differences:
* no architecture dependant stuff
* size parameters are all passed as bytes, not types (ie pass 4, not int)

!! WARNING EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE !!
Make sure the values returned by these functions are properly tested before using fcntl on anything remotely valuable!
